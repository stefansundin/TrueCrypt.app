# v4

Since macOS 10.15 does not support 32-bit binaries anymore, I decided to attempt to compile TrueCrypt for 64-bit. Thankfully, [someone else](https://github.com/neurodroid/TrueCrypt) had done the work already. I made some additional changes to support wxWidgets 3.1, which solves a couple of GUI issues and also supports Dark Mode.

This is no longer distributed as an installer, so you will need to [install osxfuse](https://osxfuse.github.io/) first.

**Note:** This should work for macOS 10.9 and up, but the lowest that I have tested is 10.13.

**I have not tested this extensively yet. Please consider this highly experimental! Please open an issue if you encounter a problem!**
